# Higher-Secondary_CS
A Code Repository wherein we have most of all my Python Programs I have Explored and done in my two years of Higher Secondary School. It is kind of informal way of storing programs and not well organised. Generally I keep everything organised but this is an Exception. So if you are interested in seeing and learning something from my Experience then go ahed and Explore my Inital Days of Programming.
